# Ecosystems

Ecosystems is an easily extendable way to quickly define and test genetic algorithms. A user will be able to easily implement
an `ecosystem`, which allows them to specify an input data set, fitness function, a variety of hyperparameters, and more. 
The goal is to make the underlying genetic algorithm plumbing as generic as possible.
